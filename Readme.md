# 3D Print Toolbox

Here is my toolbox, enjoy ;)

These are the gcodes I use to check my printer (Dagoma DiscoEasy 200) is correclty configured and perform maintenance.

If you want to use the gcodes (on Dagoma DE200) and don't have a screen, juste remember to rename the file to `dagoma0.g` before inserting the SD Card.

## Disclaimer

I'm a beginner, not an expert, I created this place to gather the things I learn and avoid losing useful files (and time).
If you want to improve this repo, feel free to make some PR.
