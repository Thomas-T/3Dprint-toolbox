# Bed-levelling

A levelled bed is a good bed.

You got the STL files to use with your favorite slicer and the premade gcode (made with Cura).

My favorite is `Bed_calibration_test` as the most consistent (IMHO) and easy to read (and cheap).

`prueba_nivelacion_cama` is way most expensive but the result is really nice.
